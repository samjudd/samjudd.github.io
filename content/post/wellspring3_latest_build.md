## Build Notes

At the moment there are no tutorials and the UI is pretty minimal. Controls are listed below for using the build. 

- **W:** Move camera up.
- **A:** Move camera left.
- **S:** Move camera down.
- **D:** Move camera right.
- **Left Click:** Select character, move character, attack enemy. 
- **Space:** End turn and proceed to opponent turn.

If you want to attack, you need to be in range of a person first. 
Additionally, there are no attack animations yet, so it's hard to tell if you have attacked.
The best way to tell is that your AP will go down and if you deselect your character and click on the opposing one, they will show the damage.
